Created By David Abramov and Nikita Kogan.

The Android version of our ongoing project with the FlighGear simulator.

upon lunching this application, you will be requested to input the IP of the machine running FlightGear
and the port on which FlightGear was instructed to accept connections from.

once connected, a new activity will show a joystick, which can be used to fly the plane simulated on FlighGear,
controlling the aileron and elevator values (horizontal axe - aileron, vertical axe - elevator).

enjoy FlightInterp Android!
